# Arduino Ultrasonic Radar

## Project Overview
This project aims to construct a simple 2D ultrasonic radar system. The system uses an Arduino microcontroller to control a sweeping ultrasonic sensor, which detects the presence and distancd of objects in a 180-degree field of view. This spatial data is then transmitted to a computer and rendered in real-time as an intuitive, graphical rader display using the Processing development environment.

The final output is a functional device that mimics the principles of real-world sonar and radar systems.

## Components:
- Ultrasonic Sensor - HC-SR04.
- Arduino Uno.
- Servo Motor SG90 180 degree.
